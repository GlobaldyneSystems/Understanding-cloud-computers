<p>Due to advancement in technology, cloud computers have become an important aspect because they have aided in the sharing of information among other services to local servers and other personal devices in an organization. Cloud computers are usually harnessed to solve problems that cannot be handled by a stand-alone machine. In simple terms, cloud computers have made work easier in organizations that have adopted them.<br /><br /><em><strong>How do cloud computers work?</strong></em><br /><br />Cloud computers are specifically used for cloud computing, therefore it is important to understand how cloud computers work. The main purpose of cloud computing is to apply very intense computing power to perform multiple computations in the shortest time possible. In order to perform these functions, cloud computers require networks of different servers and other specialized connections. <br /><br />These specialized connections are spread to different data processing systems and then shared via information technology infrastructures. The IT infrastructures require large pools that are also linked together in order to transmit data in a systematic manner. In addition, these cloud computers use different virtualization techniques to maximize its power and perform its functions.<br /><br /><em><strong>Cloud computer standards</strong></em><br /><br />Cloud computer standards vary from one organization to another depending on the manner in which they perform their functions. In addition, there are different technologies that are used to operate these cloud computers. There are cloud computer standards that are defined basing on the source of software for instance the open source or closed source software, and also different capabilities displayed by cloud computers like mobile commerce or mobile mash ups.<br /><br />The advantage of having variable cloud computer standards is that organizations can freely upgrade or change how they function whenever need arises.<br /><br /><em><strong>Key characteristics of cloud computers</strong></em><br /><br />1.    Agile <br /><br />Cloud computers are very agile which has improved the ability of users to re provision all technological resources and other infrastructure.<br /><br />2.    Multi tenancy<br /><br />Multi tenancy allows for centralization, efficiency and utilization of all available resources.<br /><br />Sectors that rely on cloud computers<br /><br />So far, cloud computers have obtained massive appeal in different sectors for instance:<br /><br />•    Corporate data centers<br /><br />Cloud computers have enabled corporate centers to operate flexibly just like the internet in that all computing resources can be accessed easily and then shared virtually in a more scalable and secure manner. Cloud computers are beneficial to corporate data centers because they have promoted increased productivity, growth of these centers and continued customer satisfaction.<br /><br />•    Small and medium size businesses<br /><br />In small and medium sized businesses cloud computers are regarded as game changers; they have enabled these enterprises to access different resources that have expanded profitable services and shrunk loss making services.  Cloud computers also offer different subscriptions that have enabled small and medium sized businesses to add services that are beneficial and remove other services that are not worth it. <br /><br />Currently, most small and medium sized businesses have realized the need to have an adoption system that will enable all services offered to be monitored easily. Cloud computers ensure that there is constant maintenance and quick deployment of infrastructure.</p>
